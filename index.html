            <h1>The case for mask</h1>
            <p>
              Nigeria's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been commended
              globally, but we have an obvious limitation: With almost two
              hundred million citizens in the country and only about five
              hospital beds per ten thousand people (2015, World Health
              Organization), we cannot afford a full-blown pandemic. Last month,
              the USA had over 100 people infected with the COVID-19, today on
              the 8th of April, they have over one hundred thousand infected.
              Their resources are stretched, The United Kingdom currently has a
              mortality rate of over ten percent of the people infected.
              ....Nigeria must avoid a pandemic. We are not helpless, so we must
              start from what we have. Right now, in Nigeria there are: (pull
              from NCDC website update table here)
            </p>
            <p>
              The smartest thing to do right now is to checkmate the virus and
              we can do this by preventing its spread. The Federal government
              issued a lock-down order for two weeks in the first instance.
              Please comply and stay home. The next thing is to wash your hands
              thoroughly and often. However, there are times when you may have
              to go out to restock on supplies. When you need to do so, PLEASE
              WEAR A MASK.
            </p>
          </div>
          <img
            class="walkthrough-four-illustrator"
            src="./images/case_for_mask.svg"

          />
        </div>

        <div class="walkthrough-five">
          <div class="walkthrough-five-text">
            <h3>#WearYourMask</h3>
            <h1>Why you should wear a mask</h1>
            <p>
              First, from what we know so far, the virus spreads through
              droplets shed by infected individuals when they sneeze, cough,
              speak. The virus can be spread by people even when they have no
              symptoms. This means people who do not know they have the virus,
              may be spreading the virus!
            </p>
            <p>
              So, if everyone wears a mask, it will drastically reduce the rate
              of virus spread. If you have the virus, the droplets from your
              nose and mouth are contained when you go out. If you donâ€™t have
              the virus, the mask provides some protection from droplets
              directly from individuals or that may be airborne.
            </p>
            <p>
              Secondly, when you compare the rate of infection of countries that
              started wearing masks early with those that did not, the data
              clearly indicates that wearing a mask greatly reduces the rate of
              person to person spread.
